### üåå Overview
**QUANTUMDECOHERENCE** is a browser-based framework that visualizes how quantum coherence breaks down near black holes.  
The model combines simplified physical scaling laws‚ÄîHawking radiation, gravitational tidal effects, and vacuum fluctuations‚Äîinto an interactive simulation built with **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** and **Chart.js**.  
Users can adjust black-hole mass and observation distance to see how decoherence rate and Hawking temperature evolve in real time.
